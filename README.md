Mimosa LiveScript skeleton
============================

This repository contains a module template to create mimosa modules in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/).

## Skeleton information

This skeleton is pretty similar to other ones as [mimosa-module-coffeescript](https://github.com/dbashford/MimosaModuleCoffeeScriptSkeleton), however it has a Makefile that it may help you in your new LiveScript mimosa module development.

Check README.tpl.md of this repository or just README.md after you have been installed (`mimosa skel:new mimosa-module-livescript`) and executed `make`.
